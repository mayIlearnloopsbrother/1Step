# 1Step
NOTE: MY PROGRESS IN C...12 JAN 2021.. AIM: TO LEARN C.. 

1st file: "countries.c" which contains annotation I left it like that so I can look back on it
to see how easy it was to break the program.
2nd file: "up.c" will contain the code that I will be updating to make it lot harder to break the program.

ABOUT THE PROGRAM:
Output:
Asks user how many countries they have been to.
Ask to input the name of the countries.
Rate the countries 1 out of 10.

CODE USES THESE:
<STDIO.H> library, INTEGERS, CHARACTERS, STRCPY, DO WHILE LOOPS, FOR LOOPS, CONTINUE, BREAK, IF STATEMENTS
for the time being
CODE WILL POSSIBLY USE THESE IN THE FUTURE:
<STRING.H> library, ISUPPER, ISLOWER, ISALPHA

CURRENTLY:
If the user were to put more than 10. They will be asked to enter the rating untill they put
less or equals to 10.

AIM WITH THE PROGRAM:
1) User cannot enter number in the country name.
2) Possibly make the rating variable to be able to take words from 1 to 10. For e.g. 'one','two'..'ten'.
3) This is it for now.. I will update this as I set sail on my JOURNEY TO THE GRAND C
