NOTE: MY PROGRESS IN C...12 JAN 2021.. AIM: TO LEARN C.. 

1st file: "countries.c" which contains comments and serves as original copy

2nd file: "up.c" contains the updated code

ABOUT THE PROGRAM:
Output:
Asks user how many countries they have been to.
Ask to input the name of the countries.
Rate the countries 1 out of 10.

PROGRAM USES THESE:
<STDIO.H> library, INTEGERS, CHARACTERS, STRCPY, DO WHILE LOOPS, FOR LOOPS, CONTINUE, BREAK, IF STATEMENTS

PROGRAM USED THESE DURING IMPROVEMENT
ATOI



CURRENTLY:
If the user were to put more than 10. They will be asked to enter the rating untill they put
less or equals to 10.

AIM WITH THE PROGRAM:
1) User cannot enter number in the country name. DONE 13 JAN 2021
2) Possibly make the rating variable to be able to take words from 1 to 10. For e.g. 'one','two'..'ten'.
3) This is it for now.. I will update this as I set sail on my VOYAGE to THE GRAND C.

REALITY OF THE AIM:
1.User will be asked to enter the country name if they typed number'<-1' and '>=0'. /*atoi is used to convert the string into number. If the input is 0 the program still takes it as a countryName string variable*/
